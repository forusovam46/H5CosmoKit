# H5CosmoKit
(come back later still in making)

`H5CosmoKit` is a toolkit designed for handling simulation data output in `HDF5` format, 
extracting and calculating quantities such as temperature, density, 
and power spectra from these files, and subsequently visualizing the results. 
Put together to ease the entry into cosmological simulations for 
astrophysics students and cosmic enthusiasts.
