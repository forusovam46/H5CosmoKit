# H5CosmoKit
(come back later in making)
A toolkit designed for handling simulation data output in HDF5 format, calculating astrophysical and cosmological quantities such as temperature, density, and power spectra from these files, and subsequently visualizing the results. Designed to ease the entry into astrophysical and cosmological simulations for astrophysics students and cosmic enthusiasts.
